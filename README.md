# Payment Notification System with RabbitMQ, Flask and Flask-Mail

This project implements a payment notification system using RabbitMQ, Flask (a Python web framework), and Flask-Mail to simulate a real-world asynchronous messaging system. The goal is to process payments, send notifications, and notify users about the status of their payments via email.

## Project Overview

The application uses RabbitMQ to handle message queues for different stages of the process:

#### payment_queue: Handles incoming payment requests for processing.
#### notification_queue: Sends email notifications to users about their payment status.

### Tech Stack
Python
Flask (Web Framework)
RabbitMQ (Message Broker)
Flask-Mail (Email Sending Service)
JSON (Data format)

### Installation and Setup
### 1. Install Python
Ensure that you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from Python Official Website.

### 2. Install Required Python Packages
You need the following Python packages for the project. You can install them using pip:
  pip install pika Flask Flask-Mail

### 3. Install RabbitMQ
Install RabbitMQ and set it up on your system. Follow the instructions in the RabbitMQ Installation Guide to install and configure RabbitMQ.

### 4. Set Up Gmail SMTP for Sending Emails
In order to send email notifications via Gmail, you'll need to set up Flask-Mail to work with Gmail's SMTP server. Use your Gmail credentials or create an app-specific password.

Set up your Gmail SMTP credentials in your app.config:
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'  # Replace with your email
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your-email-password'  # Replace with your password

## How It Works
### Payment Request Handling
The Flask application exposes an endpoint POST /make-payment that accepts payment data in JSON format. When a payment request is made, the data is sent to the payment_queue in RabbitMQ for further processing.

### Processing Payments
Once a message is added to the payment_queue, the system processes the payment by consuming the message from the queue and acknowledging the message with channel.basic_ack().

### Sending Notifications
After processing a payment, the data is forwarded to the notification_queue. The send_email function listens for messages on this queue and sends an email notification to the user using Flask-Mail.

### Email Notification
After the payment is processed successfully, an email notification is sent to the user confirming their payment details.

### Running the Application

### 1. Start RabbitMQ
Ensure that RabbitMQ is running on your machine. You can start it by using:
rabbitmq-server start

### 2. Run the Flask Application
Once RabbitMQ is running, you can start the Flask application by running the following command:
python app.py
This will start the Flask server and expose the /make-payment endpoint. You can test the endpoint by sending a POST request to http://localhost:5000/make-payment.

### Test the Payment System
### 1. Sending a Payment Request
You can send a test payment request using a tool like Postman. Here is an example POST request:

URL: http://localhost:5000/make-payment

Body (JSON):
{
    "user": "test-user@example.com",
    "paymentType": "Credit Card",
    "cardNo": "1234567890123456"
}

### 2. Observe the RabbitMQ Queues
Once a payment request is processed, you can observe the payment_queue and notification_queue in the RabbitMQ Management Interface at http://localhost:15672 (default login: guest / guest). You should see the messages in the respective queues.

### 3. Check for Email Notification
After processing the payment, an email notification will be sent to the userâ€™s email address provided in the request. Check the inbox of the provided email address for a payment confirmation email.

## Conclusion
This system simulates a payment processing and notification system using RabbitMQ for message queuing and Flask-Mail for email notifications. It's designed to handle asynchronous operations like processing payments and notifying users without blocking the main application flow.
